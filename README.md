# 2048-AI-Starter-Code

This is the starter code for 2048 AI project hosted by UC Berkeley IEEE Student Branch
1. User_game: The traditional one-human-player 2048 game
2. AI_game: Run one-AI-player 2048 game
3. AI_Move: the basic tile move/merge logic based on 2048 rules
4. AI_Minimax: Minimax algorithm for 2048 tree. Max is the AI playing the game, and Min is the computer which generates new 2 or 4 tile randomly
5. AI_Heuristics: The heuristics function to rank/compare possible branch grids. This will be used to collect the best possible move in AI_Minimax
